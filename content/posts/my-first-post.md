Hey there, I am Sergio Guillen publishing via Github pages :smile:.

This blog is a project I will take again and publish content different from my [previous blog](http://donkeysharp.blogspot.com/) which was mostly about Microsoft technologies. Since I stopped using those technologies &mdash;that I still get impressed with them e.g. C#&mdash; I had the good luck to meet new technologies, so I want to share some experiences I had with them or stuff I've been researching.

This blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) which is a static site generator. I like it a lot!

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/donkeysharp).
