Hi, I am Sergio Guillen Mantilla publishing via Github pages :smile:.

This is a project I will take again and publish content different than my previous <a target="_blank" href="http://donkeysharp.blogspot.com/">blog</a> which was mostly about Microsoft technologies. Since I stopped using this kind of technologies &mdash;that I still get impressed with them e.g. C#&mdash; I had the good luck to meet new technologies, so I want to share some experiences I had with them or stuff I've been researching.

This blog is powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo</a> which is a static site generator. I like it a lot!

You can follow me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/donkeysharp">Twitter</a>.
