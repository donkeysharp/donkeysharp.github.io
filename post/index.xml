      <description>In this post, I will present a solution (one I personally find quite tidy) to a problem I encountered with AWS SSO and the Serverless Framework.
Serverless Framework is one of my favorite tools when I need to work with AWS Lambda and other serverless services, it is an alternative to AWS SAM, but personally, I prefer Serverless Framework due to its support for various cloud providers and plugins. Previously, I had used Serverless to access AWS API by configuring my ~/.</description>

      <title>Mocking EC2 metadata server locally</title>

      <description>Some time ago I was working on creating a local docker-based development environment for some microservices at work so developers can have the necessary infra components on their machines and that will help them with their daily tasks. Initially, the business logic of some microservices were a black box to me. After containerizing the applications and creating the docker-compose setup, some of them started failing and after checking the logs it turns out that the applications were using AWS SDK to get ec2 instance metadata.</description>

      <title>What Happens When A Linux Process Goes To Sleep?</title>

      <description>It is possible when you are writing code, at some point you might need to pause the execution of a process by calling the sleep(NUMBER_OF_SECONDS) function depending on the problem you are solving. In this post, I will share what I learned so far while investigating the internal kernel mechanisms that make the sleep function work the way it does.
I appreciate your feedback. I am not an expert on this topic as Linux Kernel&amp;rsquo;s internals are new for me, it was just my curiosity that drove me to get into kernel&amp;rsquo;s source code, and wanted to share what I learned.</description>

      <description>Hello, during the months of October and November different social and political conflicts occurred in Bolivia, this entry is not so much to discuss the political issue, it will be a 100% technical entry but it is related to those events.
The previous week a large number of clients from a local ISP received an SMS with a link bit.ly to an MP4 video in Dropbox that was later deleted.</description>

      <description>Hi, some time ago I posted about my initial setup in my Debian personal machines that use for work or personal projects. Some of the things I setup are: applications, desktop look and feel, etc. The last months I installed and re-installed my Debian machines so many times in different computers that I use (new computers, new hard drives, etc.) and this taks was repetitive.
Basically what I was doing was to review my previous blog post and repeat those steps.</description>

      <description>The other day when I went out eating with my friend Francisco, he commented me about a personal project and what he wanted to accomplish. Listening to his questions the first tool that came to my mind that would solve some of the challenges he has was OpenSSH.
What is SSH? SSH is a short for Secure Shell, it&amp;rsquo;s a protocol to manage services inside a network using a secure channel.</description>

      <title>Gocho, Sharing files in a local network</title>

      <guid>https://blog.donkeysharp.xyz/post/gocho-file-sharing/</guid>
      <description>Hey,during my free time I was working a side project called Gocho. This application allows the user to share files in a local network e.g. home network, work, etc. with the difference that it will auto-discover other nodes. In this post I will explain what this application is all about, why I wrote it and some challenges that came up duting the development.
Why I wrote this app? First I wanted to share a directory in a local network without the need of others having to ask for my local ip address or the port where I published the files.</description>

      <description>Hi, I am Sergio Guillen Mantilla publishing via Github pages ðŸ˜„.
This is a project I will take again and publish content different than my previous blog which was mostly about Microsoft technologies. Since I stopped using this kind of technologies â€”that I still get impressed with them e.g. C#â€” I had the good luck to meet new technologies, so I want to share some experiences I had with them or stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching.</description>
