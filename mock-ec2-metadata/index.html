Initially, the business logic of some microservices were a black box to me. After containerizing the applications and creating the docker-compose setup, some of them started failing and after checking the logs it turns out that the applications were using AWS SDK to get ec2 instance metadata.\nFor those who are not familiar with EC2 metadata, it is a set of HTTP endpoints that are served in the 169.254.169.254 IP address. This is used to retrieve metadata such as instance ip, AWS region, availability zone, IAM credentials, etc. And internally the AWS SDK uses these enpodints for the same purpose.\nBy default, any user from their local machines won’t be able to reach 169.254.169.254 because it is part of the IPv4 Link-Local Address space. So we have two problems:\nRoute all traffic to that special IP address somewhere that is known. Simulate all the HTTP metadata endpoints. Making 169.254.169.254 available locally Fortunately, it is possible to make traffic to 169.254.169.254 to work locally or in a docker-based local environment. Linux and MacOS provide tools that make these kinds of tasks simple.\nDepending on the operating system you are using, there are different ways to route traffic 169.254.169.254 to the local interface.\nIn MacOS you can do it by running the command:\n$ sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 169.254.169.254 In Linux, there are different options:\nUsing ifconfig:\n$ sudo ifconfig lo:0 169.254.169.254 netmask 255.255.255.255 Using iptabes:\n$ sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d 169.254.169.254 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1 This way any network connection going to 169.254.169.254 will go to our local machine under the hood.\nSimulate all the HTTP metadata endpoints Because a lot of engineers might have the same issue which is accessing the metadata server in a local environment, AWS decide to create a mock server that serves all the HTTP endpoints. The project amazon-ec2-metadata-mock helps us with that.\nJust download the binary for your operating system from its releases page and you can start using it.\nSome options that it has are: For the AWS SDK to work when trying to request metadata, a request to http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data must work. Fortunately, we solved the issue of pointing 169.254.169.254 to localhost in the previous section. ec2-metadata-mock by default exposes itself in port 1338, so to trick AWS SDK we need to expose the fake endpoints in port 80.\nFor that, we only need to run it as:\n$ sudo ec2-metadata-mock -p 80 Putting it all together! Now that we know how to route traffic to 169.254.169.254 wherever we want and we have a fake EC2 metadata server, we can join everything and have a fully docker-based development environment.\nFor this, I am going to have a container for the ec2-metadata-mock tool and another which will be named debug that might represent any application that will need access to the EC2 metadata mock server.\nThe source code for this experiment can be found in this repository.\nSo the Docker compose file will look like this:\nversion: '3' services: mock_metadata: image: ec2-metadata-mock build: context: . dockerfile: Dockerfile.metadata-mock debug: image: ec2-metadata-debug build: context: . dockerfile: Dockerfile.debug environment: MOCK_HOSTNAME: mock_metadata command: - sleep - '3600' cap_add: - NET_ADMIN And it contains a container that will run the ec2-metadata-mock server in port 80 and a debug container that simulates an application. Remember the goal is to make any HTTP request from within the application container (in this case the debug container) to http://169.254.169.254/ and the connection goes to the metadata server container under the hood.\nFor applications to route traffic to metadata server, I added an entry point script that runs before the application starts. It retrieves the internal IP address used in the docker network for the metadata server container, then it creates an iptable rule that routes any traffic to 169.254.169.254 to the metadata server ip address. It is important to note that we need to add the NET_ADMIN Linux capability in order to use iptables inside a container.\n#!/bin/bash if [[ -z $MOCK_HOSTNAME ]]; then echo \"MOCK_HOSTNAME must be set\" exit 1 fi mock_ip_address=$(dig +short $MOCK_HOSTNAME) echo 'INFO - Make traffic to 169.254.169.254 go through local mock server' iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d 169.254.169.254 -j DNAT --to-destination ${mock_ip_address} exec $@ So once running the whole solution, we can test that indeed we can curl 169.254.169.254 from within the debug container.\n$ docker exec -it local-ec2-metadata_debug_1 curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 Recommendations Although this solution uses iptables and works, I will investigate and make an update to this post if it is possible to define a custom network in docker-compose using the link-local range and assign a specific ip address to the ec2-metadata container.\n",

<p>For those who are not familiar with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html">EC2 metadata</a>, it is a set of HTTP endpoints that are served in the <code>169.254.169.254</code> IP address.

Remember the goal is to make any HTTP request from within the application container (in this case the <code>debug</code> container) to <code>http://169.254.169.254/</code> and the connection goes to the metadata server container under the hood.</p>
<p>For applications to route traffic to metadata server, I added an entry point script that runs before the application starts. It retrieves the internal IP address used in the docker network for the metadata server container, then it creates an iptable rule that routes any traffic to <code>169.254.169.254</code> to the metadata server ip address. It is important to note that we need to add the <code>NET_ADMIN</code> <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">Linux capability</a> in order to use iptables inside a container.</p>

<p>Although this solution uses iptables and works, I will investigate and make an update to this post if it is possible to define a custom network in docker-compose using the link-local range and assign a specific ip address to the ec2-metadata container.</p>
